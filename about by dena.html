<h1>Van Gogh's websiite</h1>
<h2>The best artist in the history</h2>

<main>
	<p style="font-size:20px;">
	was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most famous and influential
	figures in the history of Western art. In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings,
	most of which date from the last two years of his life.<span> They include landscapes, still lifes, 
	portraits, and self-portraits characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive
	brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art.</span> He was not commercially successful and,
	struggling with severe depression and poverty, committed suicide at the age of 37.

	<p style="font-size:20px;"> Van Gogh suffered from mental illness, psychotic episodes, delusions and, although he worried about his mental stability, often neglected his physical health, did not eat properly, and drank heavily.
<span>	His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation between the two when, in a rage, Van Gogh severed a part of his own left ear with a razor. After, he spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at Saint-RÃ©my. 
	Once he discharged himself and moved to the Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris, he came under the care of the homeopathic doctor Paul Gachet.</span>
	His depression persisted and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh is believed to have shot himself in the chest with a revolver, dying from his injuries two days later, with his brother Theo at his side.
